          <h2>Recipe instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>BLISTER TOMATOES In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.
              Add tomatoes (whole) and sear, stirring occasionally, until they burst
              and soften, about 7 minutes. Turn heat off. Chop if extra-large.</li>
            <li>At the same time, in a large heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven,
                heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onions. Saute until
                golden about 10-12 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, saute 2 more minutes
                until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, saute 1 minute, stirring.  Add 2 cups warm stock (enough to cover
              the rice), saffron and smoked paprika, stir and bring to a simmer. Simmer until
              most of the liquid is absorbed. Add 1 cup broth and the tomatoes and all their
              juices. Stir until all the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1 cup at a
              time, letting the rice absorb it slowly, stirring often over med-low heat, until
              the rice is plumped, slightly al dente, yet creamy, about 20-25 minutes.
              You may not need all 8 cups. </li>
            <li>tir in the butter and parmesan. Season generously with salt, pepper,
              and optional chili flakes.  Taste, adjust salt. If bland, it probably
              needs more salt.</li>
            <li>Serve as a flavorful side or vegetarian main,
              garnishing with fresh parsley and lemon zest.</li>
