          <h2>Recipe instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <h3>Dough Instructions</h3>
            <li>Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water.
              When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a
              smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add
              additional flour. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and
              place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up
              to a week.</li>
            <h3>Sauce Instructions</h3>
            <li>Remove tomatoes from their canning liquid and discard the liquid. Squish or blend the
              tomatoes until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and mix until smooth. Makes enough for four
              pizzas.</li>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <li>Place pizza stone on middle rack and preheat oven on its maximum temperature for one hour.
              Use convection setting, if available. After pre-heating, stretch pizza dough and place on a
              well-dusted peel (stone-ground whole-wheat flour works best). Top with sauce, dusting
              of parmesan, and then the mozzarella. Bake for 5-6 minutes. Rest on cooling rack
              before slicing.</li>
